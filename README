Version 0.4

Changes from previous versions:
Added the calculation of triangles normals and the possibility of using VBOs.

Summary all code:
-Implementation of a opencl helper library, covering almost all verbose funcionality
-Implementation of the mc algorithm with opencl (geometry and shading)
-Algorithm provided with compation, allowing to save processing time
-Possibility of using VBOs
-Algorithm allows the processing of datasets larger than the device's memory (base work for multi-device)
